# Hotel Listing API
The HotelListingAPI project is all about creating a special tool that gives you easy access to information about hotels. Imagine having a magic key that opens up a treasure chest of details about hotels from around the world â€“ things like how much they cost, what amenities they offer, and where they're located.

This project is like building a super helpful travel encyclopedia that anyone can use. Whether you're a computer whiz making a cool travel app or just planning a trip, our API will make sure you have the most accurate and trustworthy hotel info at your fingertips.

Technologies that used in this project: `.NET Core`, `Seq`, `Azure Db`, `SQL`, `REST API`
